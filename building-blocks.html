title: 'Building Blocks'

<p>These are some of the common building blocks I have pullled from my research into this layer of the API space.</p>

<h2>Core Elements</h2>

<td align="left" valign="top">
<ul>
<li><strong>Workspace</strong> - Workspace definition tooling and services, allowing APIs to be an integrated part of the IDE workspaces, either by default or custom addition.</li>
<li><strong>Project</strong> - Allowing developers to break up API development into specific projects, providing well defined, project focused organization for API integration.</li>
<li><strong>Worker</strong> - Are there options for creating specific works, that allow specific API integrations to be established, and run in isolation as specific workers or jobs.</li>
<li><strong>Container</strong> - Are there options to be able to containerize individual API integrations, isolating them into specific virtualized instances. </li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong> - What API focused resources are available within an IDE environment. How do developers find documentation, and other resources that support them in their integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong> - What analytics are available to support API integrations, during development? Is the ability to track and measure API related integrations during design and development time.</li>
<li><strong>Environment</strong> - Is there the option for establishing separate environments within an IDE. Are developers able to segment and group their API integrations into multiple environments.</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - </li>
<li><strong>Editor(s)</strong> - Are there options for multiple editors, depending on media or file type, or possible set per project and environment levels, within the IDE.</li>
<li><strong>Plugins</strong> - Does the IDE environment allow for plugins, and extending the environment? Plugins allow for the introduction of 3rd party tools and services into the IDE workspace.</li>
<li><strong>Autocomplete</strong> - One of the hallmark features of an IDE, is autocomplete for specific languages and frameworks. In this scenario autocomplete is focused on dictionaries created by API definitions, meant for specific integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Themes</strong> - Are there theme options, allowing the environment, workspace, and projects to be custom defined by stored themes.</li>
<li><strong>Customize</strong> - Are there options for customizing the IDE, from look and feel, to the functionality.</li>
</ul>
